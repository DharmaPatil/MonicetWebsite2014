<p class="content">The <acronym>MONICET</acronym> project was born after some talks between some Whale Watching companies established on SÃ£o Miguel Island (Futurismo, Picos de Aventura and Terra Azul) and the University of Azores researchers. After these meetings was clear a big concern coming from the companies to help in the research and conservation of the cetaceans on the Azores, for this reason they started to work together with the researchers in order to create the <acronym>MONICET</acronym>.</p> 
<p class="content">The aim of this project is to establish methodolgies to standarize and validate the data coming from the Whale Watching companies working on the Azores, and to create an extinsive database to be used for conservation research.</p> 
<p class="content">To reach this goal a close relation between the companies and the reserachers will be established in order to develop the most efficient way, for both sides, to obtain the maximum and useful information. In addition several consultants with experience on the field will help us to create an useful scientific database.</p> 
<p class="content">Creating a Long Term Database of cetaceans on the Azores area will allow future important studies in a cetacean hot spot area. Also will provide knowledge and information to the Whale and Dolphin Watching companies to improve their perfomance and also providing a scientific and conservacionist side to their operations.</p>
